# Introduction

This repo is the Pytorch code for our paper “Relation-Aware Transformer for Portfolio Policy Learning” in IJCAI 2020.

## Differences from the article version  
Note that this library is a part of our main project, and it is several versions ahead of the article.

* In decision-making layer, we construct the leverage operation through two softmax heads, and it's performance is similar to the result of using three softmax heads.

# Dependencies
python 3.7.3 (Anaconda)

pytorch 0.4.1.post2

cudnn 7.4.1

# Dataset
The raw data of Crypto-A is accessed with Poloniex[<sup>[1]</sup>](#refer-anchor-1).  We provide the Crypto-A dataset in link[<sup>[2]</sup>](#refer-anchor-2), where data selection is based on the method  in [<sup>[3]</sup>](#refer-anchor-3). Please download ./database to the same directory as the main.py. The statistics of Crypto-A are summarized as below. 
| Dataset|Assets| Training | Test|
| ---------- | :-----------:  | :-----------: |:-----------: |
|Crypto-A|12|2016.01-2017.11|2017.11-2018.01|



# Build
File main.py mainly contains the construction of RAT network, data preprocessing, the fitting model process and testing process. File run_mian.sh mainly contains the parameter configurations of training RAT.
 
## Running

cd ${RAT_ROOT}/RAT-master

./run_main.sh


## Configurations

The figure shows the entire structure of RAT, and we detail some related parameter configurations in run_main.sh as below.

--x_window_size

    The length of the price series.
    
--local_context_length

    The length of local price context.
    
--daily_interest_rate

    The interest rate of the loan for one day.
    
--log_dir

    The directory to save the log.
    
--model_dir

    The directory to save the model.
    
--model_index

    Set a unique ID for the model.

# Logging
After training process, the model is saved in ${SAVE_MODEL_DIR}/${MODEL_INDEX}.pkl.
After testing process, the backtest results are saved in ${LOG_DIR}/train_summary.csv. It contains metrics such as fAPV, SR, CR and basktest_history.
